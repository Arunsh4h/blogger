Most individuals who get into cryptocurrencies wait for prices to rise to sell their currencies and thus make a profit. But this is not the only way to generate income through virtual currencies. Another method, called "staking", allows you to value your cryptocurrency portfolio with minimal risk and (almost) without doing anything, while receiving rewards. What is the definition of crypto staking? How it works ? For what advantages? After reading this article, you will be ready to do cryptocurrency staking!

**What is crypto staking?**
To give an easy-to-understand definition of cryptocurrency staking , we can compare this process to a financial investment. It is, in essence, to immobilize assets (in this case: virtual currencies) over a determined period, in order to produce interest, as one would do with a savings account.

The practice of staking cryptocurrencies is similar to mining, this activity which consists of validating transactions in order to receive, in return, cryptocurrencies. For example, “mining” Bitcoin earns bitcoins. The problem is that this process is complex, very energy-intensive, and requires investing in powerful and expensive hardware.

" Crypto staking" is simpler than "mining", and allows you to value your digital currencies by freeing yourself from these many constraints. All you have to do is hold a cryptocurrency portfolio, immobilize a certain number of tokens (crypto units) in a “staking pool” (usually a dedicated platform), and let the network work. To do this, you have to “bet” all or part of your portfolio, hence the term “staking” which refers to the gesture of “putting something into play”.

**How does staking work?**
Now that you know the definition of crypto staking , it remains to be seen how it works. As explained above, “staking” currencies amounts to betting them (“locking” them in the jargon) to earn interest, on the same principle as a savings account. But what happens while the tokens are immobilized? They are placed in a smart contract and participate in operations that take place on the blockchain, on the principle of a “consensus mechanism” called Proof of Stake, which itself is an “improvement” of Proof of Work. Don't panic, you will immediately understand what is going on.

**Proof of Work, Proof of Stake and cryptocurrency staking**
Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are two consensus mechanisms that compensate for the lack of a central authority responsible for managing cryptocurrencies, which are based on a decentralized system. Even though staking relies on PoS , it is useful to define PoW as well.

The Proof of Work consists, for users, in validating blocks of the blockchain through mining. This mechanism is however limited, not only for the reasons reported above, but also because it only applies to relatively simple environments such as Bitcoin. In the event of activities that are too large or too heavy to manage, blockages are commonplace.

The Proof of Stake was designed to overcome the limits imposed by PoW and validate blocks in more complex environments, such as that of Ethereum. Participants, called "validators", stake tokens for a chance to add a block to the blockchain. The allocation of the right to validate a block depends on the size and duration of the staking , in other words: the number of tokens wagered and the duration of immobilization. In short, PoS makes it possible to validate blockchain blocks without practicing mining, which eliminates the need for energy and hardware, simply by locking tokens. This is how staking works.

**What are the benefits of staking?**
For those who hold cryptocurrency, staking has three main advantages :

-Staking is a way to generate income with virtual currencies passively. In this, it is a good alternative to trading, which requires closely monitoring the evolution of assets.
-Staking makes it possible to generate interest, paid according to a frequency defined in advance. However, the average return can be very high, with some cryptocurrencies promising up to 30% annual interest (such as Kava). These rewards are paid, most of the time, in the original currency of the network. During this time, you continue to benefit from the natural evolution of the price of the assets placed in the "staking pool" .
-Crypto staking contributes to blockchain security and efficiency. By immobilizing tokens, you help make it more resilient and improve its transaction processing speed. In some cases, you can even touch "governance tokens" and give your opinion on the evolution of the blockchain.
 
**How is staking rewarded?**
The reward system is at the heart of cryptocurrency staking . In return for immobilizing your digital assets for a certain period of time, you receive a predefined reward in the form of interest allocated to the “pool”, similar to savings interest on a regulated account. This mechanism is based on a logic of capitalization: the more a currency is "staked", the more it strengthens the confidence of investors, not to mention that the platforms use these assets to manage their transactions (as banks do). 

To receive this reward, you must have been elected "validator" by the network, which leads to validating a new block of the blockchain. The validator then distributes part of the reward to the holders who have staked their cryptocurrencies. Most of the time, staking results in a reward being paid in the network's original cryptocurrency . 

However, some blockchains have created their own currencies to manage their internal operations and reward validators. Finally, the rewards are distributed according to a frequency defined upstream and vary according to the market capitalization of the asset. The challenge of staking is therefore to identify the cryptos offering the best returns.
