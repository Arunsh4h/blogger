Booming, no-code development and low-code development promise no-code (or very little) programming thanks to suitable graphical development tools and environments. Focus on what no-code/low-code represents today. No code solutions are designed for non-developers who know little or nothing about code languages to use and develop software. Low Code is a way for the most advanced to design digital solutions quickly with a minimum of manual coding.

We are talking more and more about Low Code and No Code development, but what impact do they have on the digital transformation of companies?

Low Code and No Code development tools put cool features like drag-and-drop interfaces in everyone's hands. This allows non-developers in each operating company to quickly develop, deploy and maintain No Code solutions. According to a study by analyst firm Gartner, more than 50% of VSEs and VSEs will have adopted a Low Code or No Code application platform by 2023, largely due to the shortage of developers and challenges related to skills required by the code.

**They have almost tripled, from 10% to 26% according to a KPMG study. Digital transformation is at the fingertips of anyone or every business. **
The goal of No Code is also to give more autonomy to teams in companies. For example to be able to contribute to the development of software in No code or Low Code such as websites or applications with tools like Bubble . It also saves valuable resources , and further lowers barriers to entry. Finally, No Code or Low Code has significant advantages for the non-developer audience, but let's not forget that not all developers want to write or own code that could easily be achieved by Low Code or No Code. So this is a win for developers and non-developers alike!

Speed is another advantage of the Low Code and No Code approach. Digital transformation has been a big priority for years. The speed and the need of companies for new applications or software is always greater to digitize business processes. Low code and No code therefore help companies to deliver digital solutions more quickly.

**The birth of Low Code and No Code development! **
When some developers think of the term "low code", it reminds them of the days when Microsoft's Visual Basic was often used to prototype applications that would then be developed in C++ or later in C#. Although there was still some coding to do, the applications were created in a WYSIWYG environment (What You See Is What You Get is a visual text editor) and many third-party components allowed people with only rudimentary knowledge of programming to create fairly complete applications without writing a lot of code.

Visual Basic was originally released in 1991, was officially declared a legacy product in 2008, and was superseded by its successor Visual Basic .NET. Although many developers consider it the most feared programming language of all time, it was the first of what many consider a low-code integrated development environment. This although the first true low-code application platforms actually emerged as fourth-generation programming language and rapid application development platforms in the late 1990s and early 1990s. of the 2000s.

**Why is low code so important today?**
Removing technical barriers to entry is especially important today, especially as developers have to deal with changing customer needs and habits and tighter budgets. The needs of developers would increase by more than 50% every 10 years without the offer of such profiles being able to follow, No Code and Low Code have a bright future ahead of them. The ability to do No Code alongside your job feels like a self-service model. 

This template is great for non-developers because it makes it easy to integrate new tools and software into their existing solutions.
 
In the early days of the Internet, B2B solutions were largely aimed at a technical audience. As the demand for simple, easy-to-use solutions grows, software vendors are increasingly offering turnkey products for the core functionality of their offerings. Less technical audiences can see the core value of the solution from the get-go and only engage their developer counterparts when they dive into the solution's more complex workflows or features. No Code tools like Shopify or Webflow make it easy to get started with a basic online store, customer support via email or chat, and basic web analytics.

The use of low-code web development platforms like WordPress has helped the move towards No-Code solutions like Webflow and allowed companies to tap into this larger developer base. Areas such as customer messaging and community building have been amplified by the effects of COVID-19 and remote working which are driving further digital transformation.

What we can see is that companies using Octolio often tend, in their digitization effort, to ask existing non-technical employees to figure out how to solve certain technical problems. These employees are turning to low-code solutions to bridge this gap, and still often encounter difficulties with their overall implementation and the interconnection between all the tools. Notion , a cloud-based project management tool, has launched into the No Code enterprise app market . The goal is to allow customers to quickly adapt to constantly changing all teams such as business conditions by allowing non-programmers to create enterprise applications.

**When use cases become too advanced?**
While No Code platforms can provide enough functionality for important enterprise tools, companies need to recognize that it is not straightforward to transition from building No Code solutions to building Low Code solutions . It's important to understand your business needs and skills and know what types of products or applications are needed. There is still a significant knowledge and skill gap in transitioning a workforce from a no-code product to a low-code product.

To prevent No Code and Low Code from reaching their limits too quickly, platform providers now offer the possibility to dig deeper into the code when necessary, often through APIs.
