Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW) used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are both methods of achieving distributed consensus, i.e., they aim to secure a blockchain by providing the right economic incentives to push for real validation of transactions. What is the definition of Proof-of-Stake, and what are the specificities of this "proof-of-stake"?


**Definition of Proof-of-Stake**
Securing: this is the crucial word of Proof-of-Stake. Like Proof-of-Work, PoS in crypto responds to a significant challenge in virtual currency: guaranteeing the integrity of the blockchain, which is the basis of the operation of digital monetary exchanges, but also of all transactions carried out using cryptocurrencies.

As a reminder, the blockchain is a computer protocol organized in a chain of blocks, validated through a consensus process, within a network independent of the central authorities. Cryptocurrencies rely on a blockchain-type network to exchange files peer-to-peer, between computers, without going through a central head (banks, financial institutions, etc.). Thanks to the algorithm, computers get along with each other. On this network, "nodes" are used to validate transactions. For this, there are different methods, including proof of work and proof of stake.

In short, the definition of Proof-of-Stake is as follows: it is a method of validating transactions on the blockchain, which makes it possible to reach a distributed consensus, in order to secure this blockchain and guarantee the integrity transactions. Through incentives (usually in the form of token earnings – a term that refers to cryptocurrency tokens), users are incentivized to participate in this consensus in various ways.

 

**What are the specificities of Proof-of-Stake?**
Proof-of-Stake replaces a mechanism based on computing power with another, based on the active use of its capital. It makes use of the blockchain asset in question, for example tezzies (XTZ) or EOS (EOS) on the Tezos and EOS smart-contract platforms.

Because of this, it is not possible to just plug in and start mining like with PoW. There are therefore no "miners" of cryptocurrencies with proof of stake. You have to buy tokens or earn them in some way and then immobilize them – this is called staking. Thus, crypto blockchains in PoS are always subject to fundraising in order to perform a first allocation of the native asset.

The holders of the asset in question have the option of placing part or all of their capital in escrow with the aim of directly participating in the validation of the blocks or otherwise of voting for an actor who will do it for themselves according to the implementations of this system. In crypto, Proof-of-Stake is therefore a validation method that works very differently from that of proof of work , although the result is the same: reaching a consensus to validate transactions. We will see below how the two methods oppose each other, in the Proof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work section .
**What are the differences between Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work?**
PoS and PoW are two different methods for achieving the same goal: validating transactions on the blockchain. Here is a guide to understand how these two approaches differ, in their philosophy as well as in their applications.

 

**Proof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work**
Originally, there is Bitcoin. To be able to do without intermediaries, Bitcoin relies on a mechanism called "proof of work", used to determine how the blockchain reaches a consensus. Understand: how the network can guarantee the validity of a transaction, without interference (which, in the traditional monetary exchange ecosystem, is the role of financial institutions).

PoW is based on cryptography (hence the name "cryptocurrencies" ): mathematics so complex that it takes great computing power to solve the equations and allow the algorithm to authenticate transactions. For this purpose, we go through "mining", the fact of solving the equations of the blockchain.

Subsequently, other validation mechanisms have emerged, such as Proof-of-Stake . This proof of stake works on a very different principle. Here, there is no question of mining by calculation: the algorithm is also cryptographic, but it is based on the tokens stored by users. The stake takes into account the number of coins (or tokens) that users hold in the blockchain they are looking to mine.

**Proof-of-Stake: how are transactions verified?**
In the Proof-of-Stake model , there is no "mining". To verify transactions, the blockchain algorithm takes into account the cryptocurrency coins stored by users in it. These tokens are "frozen" and used to "bet" on the network (hence the name "proof of stake", in the sense of "stake"), via an exchange platform.

Users, who hold the staked tokens, are rewarded by the network in the event of a validated block. This reward takes the form of interest paid into the currency wallet, most often in the currency that matches the blockchain. The chances of winning the reward are proportional to the percentage of currency held in relation to the total circulating on the network. For example, if there are 1 million units on the blockchain, and you buy 200,000 coins to stake them, you will hold 20% of the total currencies in circulation: this will give you a 20% chance of winning the associated reward at each block.

Participating in this validation method does not require a lot of computing power. In contrast, most Proof-of-Stake crypto blockchains require a minimum number of coins to bet . However, given the value of cryptocurrency, this can very quickly represent huge sums of money!

**Hybrid crypto blockchain models in PoS/PoW**
These two consensus mechanisms used on the crypto blockchain (Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work) having advantages and disadvantages, it was logical to try to develop a hybrid system capable of combining the best of both solutions. . This system is called a "PoS/PoW hybrid model".

A hybrid algorithm always requires a lot of computing power with regard to the proof of work. However, the required power is limited since, at the same time, the system relies on an amount of coins to wager – with regard to the "proof of stake" aspect. This model is nevertheless used by few cryptocurrencies to date – Decred is one of them.
