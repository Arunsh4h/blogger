Tether USDT is a stablecoin issued by Tether Limited. Its objective is to replicate the value of the US dollar (USD). If its price remains stable and its advantages numerous, this cryptocurrency has experienced its share of controversy for several years. Thinking of investing in Tether? Discover, in this article, everything you need to know about Tether.

**Tether  : what is it ?**
Tether, whose stock symbol is USDT, is a stablecoin issued on different blockchains and whose value is backed by that of the American dollar (USD). Created in 2014, it plays a key role in the ecosystem of crypto-assets: its price always remains close to $1 and allows you to quickly protect yourself from market volatility without exchanging your crypto-assets for a fiduciary currency.

**History of Crypto Tether**
JR Willett developed the beginnings of Tether in a white paper in 2012. He described the possibility of creating additional currencies on the Bitcoin protocol, via new layers. He was then working on Mastercoin, a cryptocurrency in which he implements this idea. Mastercoin thus becomes the basis of Tether and one of its founders, Brock Pierce, will then be known as a co-founder of Tether.

Realcoin was announced in July 2014. It is the direct ancestor of Tether. The first tokens were issued in October 2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Omni Layer protocol is then used. At the end of that same year, Realcoin officially became Tether. The company was then based in Hong Kong and Switzerland. A private beta version is launched on this occasion, with the promise of guaranteeing 100% in its original currency each Tether + token. Three currencies are involved: the dollar (USTether), the euro (EuroTether) and the yen (YenTether).

The Bitfinex crypto-trading platform, one of the largest sources of Bitcoin exchanges in the world, added Tether in 2015. A first controversy erupted in 2017, when links between Bitfinex and Tether were revealed, throwing a veil on the supposed neutrality of the platform.

In 2017 Tether is released on the Omni layer of Litecoin. Later that year, Tether launched dollar and euro tokens on Ethereum. In 2018, Tether alone represented nearly 80% of Bitcoin transactions. Other controversies arose during this period, including suspicions of Bitcoin price manipulation. A lawsuit was filed in 2019 by the New York State Attorney General. Bitfinex being criticized for using Tether reserves to cover its losses.

**Tether, a simple but effective principle**
Like other “stable cryptocurrencies”, Tether seeks to meet a simple need: to offer an alternative to investors seeking to sell volatile cryptocurrencies, without going through fiat currencies such as the euro or the dollar.

For this, Tether is based on a principle of collateralisation by reserve: each USDT created corresponds to one dollar (USD) in the bank account of the company  Tether Limited , associated with the firm. There is therefore no need for complex mechanisms as with decentralized stablecoins such as  MakerDAO . The price is therefore maintained by a balance between supply and demand, via a constant demand for $1 from Tether Ltd. A solution which is therefore centralized but which can be set up quickly and evolve according to needs. It works very well as long as the users are confident that the dollar reserves exist corresponding to the units of USDT in circulation.

Note that the creation of Tether is closely linked to its parent company: Bitfinex, since without an available banking partner, it did not have the possibility of receiving or sending dollars to its customers. Tether is therefore first and foremost an alternative solution allowing customers to enter or exit the market without remaining "exposed" to Bitcoin.

**How does Tether work?**
For crypto-asset investors, the interest of Tether is to have exposure to the value  of the US dollar , without having to manage real dollars. A faster solution, which is also advantageous for exchanges that do not have to deal with the drastic regulations linked to the dollar.

Another interest for the investor:  to quickly protect against the volatility of the crypto market , or to resell against a fiduciary currency like the euro. Thus, the corresponding tax charges are not triggered.

**Tether and the Bitfinex company: a trust deficit**
For several years, numerous events have cast doubt on Tether's assurances that there is indeed a dollar for every USDT in circulation, the quantity of which amounts to 67 billion as of September 2021. Among others, repeated requests for audits independents have remained a dead letter, and the storage of the funds is carried out with a rather anonymous bank located in the Bahamas. All this calls for a minimum of caution on the part of investors.

If it were proven that Tether's reserves do not correspond to reality, we could see a probable fall in overall market valuations and a loss of confidence that the mass media would echo with relish. .

**Evolution of Tether USD capitalization**
A decline in public confidence would first be visible in the valuation of Tether, as the price of the asset is an indicator of the level of Tether's ability to secure its reserves. At one dollar per USDT, this capacity is deemed by the robust market. At lower price levels, doubts are raised.

It should be remembered that in April 2017, Tether then announced that it was unable to make deposits and withdrawals via its Taiwanese banking partner, making it very complex or even impossible to convert a USDT into USD. An announcement that had triggered abnormal volatility on the price of Tether. At the origin of this “blockade”, a certain number of American banks including Wells Fargo who did not wish to maintain a relationship with the bank as long as Tether remained their client. A lawsuit will open between Tether and Wells Fargo, but will be dismissed.

After a short period of panic in the markets, with no alternative and needing a stablecoin to secure their positions, investors returned to USDT despite eroded confidence. The asset has since remained around its target value of one dollar.
