**Overview**
We thrive in an era where digital systems have become the backbone of our daily activities. Today, when a cyberattack occurs, it can hamper our life in several ways. Recent security research points out that most companies have poor cybersecurity policies and unprotected data, which makes them vulnerable to cyber crimes. According to Gartner, global cybersecurity spending is expected to reach $133.7 billion by 2022. As organizations increasingly feel that their cybersecurity risks are increasing, they will turn to more sophisticated methods to address risks by preventing, curing and mitigating them with modernized cybersecurity solutions. 

1. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are now being heralded as a way to help businesses detect and fix cyber crimes faster. While they have been around for decades as concepts, their recent rise to prominence can be linked to two factors:

2. AI/ML programs are computationally intensive. The recent availability of cloud computing technologies has made these algorithms feasible, and new hardware devices have also helped a lot.

3. Training AI and ML modules requires massive data. The rise of big data platforms has improved the efficiency of AI and ML programs, making them “better than humans” in a myriad of applications.

In cybersecurity, AI and ML can be used to transmit knowledge about everything we know to be good and everything we know to be bad to a machine. Thus, when an anomaly occurs, the machine will be able to detect it as good or bad.

**Possibilities when AI/ML comes to provide cyber resilience**
Cyberattacks keep getting bigger and more complex with IoT attacks, phishing and spamming, crypto jacking, data breaches, mobile malware, spying and ransomware. The data loss and disruption caused by these attacks cost businesses money and damage their reputation. Machine learning has an interesting advantage for us when it comes to ensuring cyber resilience. The ability of ML algorithms to analyze large datasets and identify anomalies and patterns in an instant is key to detecting and responding to cybersecurity events.

Automatic updates of existing software programs based on sophisticated AI assessment and ML-backed solutions can help address cybersecurity at scale. Major email providers are already using these technologies to prevent spam links, violent images, detect phishing links, malware, and instances of fraudulent payment requests. Machine learning has great potential as a defense against viruses and malware.

Until recently, anti-virus defense solutions were primarily signature-based. In other words, they identified malware by extracting a unique fingerprint. The traditional signature-based detection process is now outdated. Indeed, these signatures are useful for recognizing a given viral form and proposing a direct diagnosis or even an associated cleaning. However, when malicious tools become more sophisticated and a million have to be dealt with, such a solution may not be enough.

Tools are now needed to detect what is not known and remains invisible. For this, technologies based on artificial intelligence will no longer be an option, but a necessity in the times to come. When a child distinguishes a dog from a cat, both of which belong to the animal family, he does not assign a basic signature to 'dog' or 'cat'. He uses a powerful recognition mechanism in his brain.

A mature cybersecurity infrastructure in 2020 needs the same capability: being able to identify “goodware” or “malware” in the same way. Deep Learning then takes on its full meaning, especially when it comes to a CSOC/CSIRT. A few pioneers embarked on this adventure to mechanize an efficient artificial intelligence, capable of sorting and assisting humans in the face of millions of malicious tools.

**Use cases of AI/ML in cybersecurity**
Here are some ways to apply AI and ML to cybersecurity:

1. Forensic analysis with clustering – Data that does not match predefined parameters is grouped based on similarities or anomalies. Forensic analysis sheds light on the method of attack and the damage. As clustering allows us to gather data without the know-how of its group, it can help teams piece together the various elements after a breach.

2. Phishing and spam filtering with classification – Classification consists of classifying data according to predefined parameters. Using this technique for spam and phishing detection can help classify activities accurately and quickly.

3. Incident response and risk management – The recommendation approach ensures that ML algorithms learn from input data, past experiences, and associations to recommend decisions and approaches. This can be useful for training the algorithm based on different actions taken during various events. As it detects patterns, the algorithm can then make recommendations to mitigate risk and react to events.

4. Pentesting with Generative Frameworks – Based on historical data, ML-based programs can generate possibilities that can be applied to data as new and challenging inputs. It could also lead to new offensive technologies in the near future.

5. 0-day threat management – 0-day threats have no known or recognizable signatures. Experts use technologies such as sandboxing or core dumps to analyze some of these threats. Sandboxing involves installing a suspicious file or program in a VM sandbox and then observing its behavior to determine whether it is good or bad. This process, when done manually, can take several minutes, while AI/ML models can deliver the verdict in milliseconds.

**Use cases of AI/ML in cybersecurity**
A fundamental tenet of cybersecurity is defense in depth, which means having multiple layers of security and not relying on a single technology. There is media debate about the capabilities of AI and ML in cybersecurity, but for a well-rounded cybersecurity strategy, you need to ensure that all content a user accesses is scanned, systems are patched and updated. up to date, etc.

Additionally, some categories of cybersecurity issues are better suited than others to be addressed by AI and ML. Phishing detection, for example, has a visual component. Advances in AI and ML vision algorithms have led us to apply these techniques to detect fake websites and sound an alarm.

Similarly, AI and ML can be used to detect unusual user behavior by training the neural network on what is usual. Any other use cases for AI and ML in cybersecurity may still be in their infancy and need to be tested. When trained by cybersecurity experts, AI and ML-based cybersecurity solutions can be a great addition to your company's security postures.
