**Overview**
Cloud computing is taking over the world. According to a Cisco study, 94% of compute workloads and instances will be served by cloud data centers in 2021, compared to only 6% by traditional data centers. The principle of the cloud is not new, but with more and more companies migrating to this type of service, it is now important to understand cloud computing, as well as the nuances of its terminology and related concepts. .

**What is the cloud?**
or non-techies, the cloud can seem intimidating and abstract. The term "cloud computing" is on everyone's lips, but what exactly does it mean? The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) describes the basics of cloud computing as follows:

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, and on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage devices, applications, and services) that can be quickly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with the service provider.

Still not clear? In short, the cloud stands for the Internet, and cloud computing is a technical term that describes software and services that run over the Internet (or an intranet) rather than on servers and personal hard drives.

**How Cloud Computing Works**
The principle of operation of cloud computing differs from conventional computer hosting services in that the consumer (whether a company, an organization or an individual user) generally does not have the infrastructure necessary to support the programs or applications it uses. Instead, these items are owned and operated by a third party.

**Characteristics of cloud computing**
1. On-demand self-service: Users can access IT services through the cloud when they need them, without action from the service provider. These services must be offered entirely on demand, so that users have the control and flexibility to meet their changing needs.

2. Extended access via the network: Cloud computing services can be accessed from across the network via user-preferred tools (e.g. laptops, desktops, smartphones, etc.)

3. Pooling of resources: One of the most attractive elements of cloud computing is the pooling of resources, which makes it possible to provide large-scale computing services And allocated to different consumers based on demand.

4. Quick elasticity: Successful resource allocation requires elasticity. Resources must indeed be allocated with precision and speed, while being able to cope with significant fluctuations in demand without interruption of service or loss of quality.

5. Metered service: Based on an on-demand model, cloud computing services are quantified and accounted for. This method allows the service provider (and the client) to track usage and assess costs based on resource consumption.

**The main players in cloud computing**
Cloud services come in three main service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

1. IaaS � Infrastructure as a Service
IaaS allows users to access storage devices, networks, servers, and other computing resources through the cloud. Although the user is still responsible for managing their applications, data and other middleware, IaaS provides them with automated and scalable environments with a high degree of control and flexibility. For example, many companies use IaaS to deal with peak loads during busy periods (like holidays).

2. PaaS � Platform as a Service
This layer of services is aimed primarily at developers and operations managers, to whom service providers rent cloud-based platforms to enable them.

3. SaaS � Software as a Service
Cloud application services are the best known of the cloud service models. The software is hosted, managed and provided by a third party via the Internet (usually via a browser-based interface). By delivering their software application over the Internet, companies offload management and maintenance costs to the relevant vendor(s). The most popular SaaS solutions are email and customer relationship management software.

**Types of Cloud Computing**
1. Audience
The public cloud is probably the most common cloud computing option. In this context, all services and the corresponding infrastructure are managed off-site via the Internet and shared between several users (or tenants). Streaming services like Netflix or Hulu are a typical example of a public cloud used by consumers. Users subscribe to it through an individual account, but access is via a single platform on the Internet. A public cloud has the advantage of increasing the efficiency and profitability of shared resources. This type of cloud is generally less expensive than private and hybrid cloud solutions (as well as traditional on-premises systems) because it relies on economies of scale. Users don't have to pay for services they don't use, or worry about managing and maintaining the physical infrastructure.

2. Private
A private cloud delivers computing services over the Internet or a private network to specific users, rather than to the public at large. Instead of having multiple tenants, as with a public cloud, a private cloud typically has only one. All data is protected behind a firewall. This solution is very popular with many companies that want to benefit from the agility of the cloud while having increased personalization and security capabilities. Private clouds can be hosted onsite or offsite. Their particularity lies in their operation with a single, private tenant who has greater control over the services. Private clouds are particularly popular with organizations that place a high priority on security and compliance.

3. Hybrid
A hybrid cloud environment combines private and public cloud elements to varying degrees. Although they operate independently, the clouds in a hybrid environment communicate over an encrypted connection and enable data and application portability. It is an increasingly popular solution because it gives organizations greater flexibility to meet their IT needs.
